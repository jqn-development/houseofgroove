                	<h1>Kristina and Laszlo</h1>
                    <p>	&nbsp &nbsp Our special day couldn't have been more perfect thanks to Ludwig and Serg! We knew we had made the right decision to hire House of Groove Entertainment from the very first moment. DJ Luda met us several times before the big day to discuss all the details and get to know our likes and dislikes. He always listened to our dreams with his utmost attention and was just as excited as we were to make our wedding unforgettable. It truly was a blast since we did not have to worry about one single detail - Ludwig and Serg were right on top of everything! DJ Luda also acted as our Master of Ceremonies and kept the evening going - what a great addition to their array of services! We really enjoyed how involved they were in the planning process and stay grateful for all the help we received to perform our special bridal dance to break the ice at the reception. As a true professional, Ludwig even came to our practice dances to get a feel for it and pick the best lights and videos for our surprise boogie. The dance floor stayed crowded all night long - which speaks for a perfect testament itself - but was so greatly appreciated due to the international mixture of our wedding guests. The music was entertaining and a lot of fun - no matter how challenging it was to balance the two different cultures. Oh, and before we forget, they also did an amazing job with all the disco lights to jazz up the ballroom. To top it all off, the music videos were beyond our expectations. Every bride dreams of a wedding with no glitches - it is an easy dream come true if they hire Ludwig and Serg!</p>
                    <p>We just can't thank Luda and Serg enough for the most professional and attentive customer service they provided throughout the entire evening. Their enthusiasm, attention to detail and dedication to excellence were second to none and made our celebration the most memorable we have ever dreamed of. Thank you again...we can't wait to use your services again at other upcoming parties!</p>

                	<h1>Steve and Liz Rael</h1>
                    <p>	&nbsp &nbsp On May 19 my husband Steve and I hosted a party for our daughter and her friend.  It was a combined birthday and graduation party.  We had good food and 					great friends over to celebrate.  But, what made it the party of all parties was DJ Ludwig.  We must have dancedfrom 6pm until 10:30pm and we have the pictures to prove it. The party was held in our living room.  DJ Ludwig came out a month before to talk about the set up.  He was courteous and helpful with ideas to make it go smoothly. I felt better after the meeting because I wasn't sure what to expect. The evening of the party he arrived early to make sure all would be set up by the time the guests started showing up.  He came prepared with everything he could possibly need.  He knows exactly how to run the songs together to keep everyone moving.  There were fun lights and a large screen that showed the artists and dancing which were fun to watch.    He took all our requests with a smile and a nod.  We had all ages at our party from 6yrs - 61yrs, and they all had so much fun.  DJ Ludwig is exactly what you need for your next celebration.  I can't wait to have another excuse for a party.</p>

                &nbsp &nbsp My husband and I had our wedding in June of 2011. Luda from SNL House of Groove Entertainment came very highly recommended to us by the best man of our wedding. Prior to the &quot;big day,&quot; he met with us to discuss the music we wanted to hear and which traditional events and songs would happen. At the meeting his professionalism was obvious and he was very kind easy going. Our play list wasn't very specific, more just genres and a couple specific requests; for the traditional events like the garter toss, my husband and I hadn't discussed what song to play, so Luda quickly gave some great suggestions that we used. His knowledge of music and special events was immense so we knew we had asked the right person play at our special night. The night of the wedding, Luda arrived right on time, fully prepared and dressed to the nines! The whole night I was very antsy about the sequence of events going as planned, but Luda kept everyone right on track! Since we hadn't given a specific playlist, he filled in the time with great dance music that had our guests moving. When one of our guests had requested the Chicken Dance, one of the traditional songs I definitely did not want to hear, Luda simply said that &quot;the bride doesn't want to hear it.&quot; Thumbs up to that! And when some others who were curious about his profession asked him questions, he gladly conversed with them. My mom still says how great of a job he did and that he was so nice. We recommend Luda for any special event!

                <p>We were fortunate to have both Luda and Serg as our DJ in our Wedding Party in August 2011. They both were very professional, punctual, friendly and helpful!

The DJ booth was set up just perfect, gave easy access to them so if we had any requests we could talk to them. They listened to all of our requests and did the best job fulfilling them.
They played the best songs to keep the party going. They really care about the guests, they want everybody to have fun and dance and not just get through the night.

My family flew in from Hungary for our wedding and they still talk about Luda and Serg how excellent they were and made our night.

The best part was the music videos that went with the songs, it was all truly worth every penny.

I would highly recommend them to everybody who's about to have any kind of party and want professionalism, DJ's with great personalities and a FUN night!!

                    <P>&nbsp &nbspWe We got married May 22nd, 2010 and Luda was our DJ.  He was very punctual, and dressed nicely for our formal event. He was also easy to work with. He was unobtrusive, and was willing to do as much or as little emceeing as we wanted.  We were able to provide him with a specially mixed version of our 1st dance song, and he had a great selection of family-friendly tunes he used to keep people on the dance floor all night. We couldn't have been happier with our choice, and would highly recommend using DJ Luda to anyone who has an event to plan.</P>
                    <p>Thank you, House of Groove!</p>

                	<h1>Amy Stull - Woodman Hills community Center West</h1>
                    <P>&nbsp &nbsp We have contracted &quot;House of Groove&quot; on several occasions to DJ at our events.  They have always done a terrific job and been professional and timely.  I must highlight the last event that they did for us.  It was a Craft Show and Business Expo which took place outside.  The Colorado weather put a real damper on the event, but thanks to the DJ, everyone ended up having a good time.  They played the perfect mix of music for the crowd of people who were showcasing at this event, as well as the people attending this event.   I truly feel that our Craft Show and Business Expo would have been a real &quot;flop&quot; if it hadn't been for the excellent job that &quot;House of Groove&quot; did!</P>
