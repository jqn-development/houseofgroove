                      Our special day couldn't have been more perfect thanks to Ludwig and Serg!
                      We knew we had made the right decision to hire House of Groove Entertainment
                      from the very first moment. DJ Luda met us several times before the big day to
                      discuss all the details and get to know our likes and dislikes. He always listened
                      to our dreams with his utmost attention and was just as excited as we were to make
                      our wedding unforgettable.

                      It was a combined birthday and graduation party. We had good food and great friends
                      over to celebrate. But, what made it the party of all parties was DJ Ludwig.
                      We must have danced from 6pm until 10:30pm and we have the pictures to prove it.

                    We were fortunate to have both Luda and Serg as our DJ in our Wedding Party in August 2011.
                    They both were very professional, punctual, friendly and helpful! The DJ booth was set up
                    just perfect, gave easy access to them so if we had any requests we could talk to them.
                    They listened to all of our requests and did the best job fulfilling them. They played the
                    best songs to keep the party going. They really care about the guests, they want everybody to
                    have fun and dance and not just get through the night. My family flew in from Hungary for our
                    wedding and they still talk about Luda and Serg how excellent they were and made our night.
                    The best part was the music videos that went with the songs, it was all truly worth every penny.
                    I would highly recommend them to everybody who's about to have any kind of party and want
                    professionalism, DJ's with great personalities and a FUN night!! Wes and Viktoria stull + family

                We We got married May 22nd, 2010 and Luda was our DJ. He was very punctual,
                and dressed nicely for our formal event. He was also easy to work with.
                He was unobtrusive, and was willing to do as much or as little emceeing
                as we wanted. We were able to provide him with a specially mixed version
                of our 1st dance song, and he had a great selection of family-friendly tunes
                he used to keep people on the dance floor all night. We couldn't have been happier
                with our choice, and would highly recommend using DJ Luda to anyone who has an event to plan.
                <br/>
                Thank you, House of Groove!
